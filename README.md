# NGEC -- Next generation political event coder

This repository contains the code for the Next Generation Event Coder (NGEC), a
Python library for extracting event data from news text. The pipeline works out-of-the-box
to code events using the [PLOVER event ontology](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rm5dw/), but can 
be easily customized to produce events with a custom ontology.

It accompanies the working paper, ["Creating Custom Event Data Without Dictionaries: A Bag-of-Tricks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01331.pdf).

## Overview

We break the problem of event extraction into six steps:

1. Event classification: identify the event described in a document (e.g., PROTEST, ASSAULT, AGREE,...) using a transformer classifier trained on new data.
2. Sub-event (``mode'') classification: identify a more specific event type (e.g., PROTEST-riot, ASSAULT-aerial), also using a transformer-based classifier.
3. Context classification: identify themes or topics in a document (e.g., "human rights", "environment") using a classifier.
4. Event attribute identification: identifying the spans of text that report who carried out the event, who it was directed against, where it occurred, etc. We do this with a fine-tuned question-answering model trained on newly annotated text.
5. Actor, location, and date resolution: we resolve extracted named actors and recipients to their Wikipedia page using an offline Wikipedia index and a custom neural similarity model.
6. Entity categorization: Finally, we map the actor to their country and their "sector" code as defined by the PLOVER ontology (e.g., "GOV", "MIL", etc.)
